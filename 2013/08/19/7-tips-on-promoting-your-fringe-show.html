It&#39;s back by popular demand this year at the <a href=http://www.firehallartscentre.ca>Firehall Arts Centre</a>, now through August 24, 2013.</em></p><p>Vancouver Fringe is just around the corner! Last year&#39;s run of <em>Riverview High: The Musical</em> was a complete thrill - we put our heart and soul into the show, and we made sure we did everything we could to attract Fringe-goers. Read more for some tips and tricks on getting the word out!</p><h2>7. Create a Marketing Budget</h2><p><img src=http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pride.jpg alt=pride> <em>The Riverview High gang at the Vancouver Pride Parade</em>A lot of people throw their hands up saying &quot;We don&#39;t have any money for marketing!&quot;, and they end up not doing any promotion for their show. <strong>Don&#39;t fall into this trap!</strong></p><p>You need to spend money to ensure a successful show, so set aside as much as you feel comfortable into getting the word out. Once you&#39;ve decided how much you can spend, stick to that budget and <strong>do everything you can with the money you have</strong>.</p><p>If you don&#39;t have a lot to spend, get creative! Maybe a design student from Emily Carr might be able to help you with your poster. Or a budding photographer might help you out in exchange for ad space and some free tickets. There are opportunities out there - go make them happen!</p><h2>6. Design an Eye-Catching Poster</h2><p><img src=http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Poster-milkshake-672x1024.png alt=Poster-milkshake><strong>Use a striking, relevant image for your poster</strong>. This image is going to be the face of your branding, so make sure that it is an accurate representation of your show.</p><p>Think to yourself: <strong>Does this image convey what my show is about?</strong> Can I see myself using it across all of my marketing materials? If the answer is yes, then you&#39;ve got your image!</p><p>For <em>Riverview High: The Musical</em>, we chose the milkshake photo for our poster. This photo is very compelling, since it reminds you of Archie comic imagery, which aligns strongly with the concept of the piece.</p><p>We plastered Vancouver with our posters, hitting up coffee shops, offices, stores and flyering poles. <strong>Do your best to put up posters in businesses</strong>, since it is less likely that they will take them down until Fringe is over. Flyering poles are great for more public-facing coverage, but these will get covered in days.</p><p>If you have money, it&#39;s worth think about hiring a company to print and distribute posters around town for you. They will be able to get much better coverage than you can on your own.</p><h2>5. Build Your Identity Online</h2><p>One way to make people pay attention to you is by building an awesome web presence. By creating profiles on the major social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter) and having a great website, <strong>you&#39;ll get much more attention from media and Fringe-goers</strong>.</p><p>Your web presence does two things: 1. Makes it easy for people to learn more about your show and 2. Creates the perception that your production is not just a one-person operation.</p><p>We produced a web series on the creation of <em>Riverview High</em>, which gave people an inside look into our show. People loved these videos because it let them get a sneak peek into rehearsals, hear some songs and get to know more about the story and characters.</p><h3>Twitter</h3><p>We also used Twitter to <a href=https://twitter.com/RiverviewHighM>engage our followers and spread the word</a> about our show. To gain followers, we followed people who are into Vancouver theatre. Many of them followed back and gave us the opportunity to draw them into Riverview High. We tweeted Instagram photos of us performing at events, Vines of rehearsal footage, our YouTube videos and fun contests. <strong>Create a voice for your show and follow through with it in your tweets</strong>.</p><h3>Facebook</h3><p><img src=http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fb-banner.png alt=fb-banner></p><p>We created both a <a href=https://www.facebook.com/RiverviewHighTheMusical>Facebook page for our fans</a> and a Facebook event for the actual Fringe run. We also made Facebook cover photos (pictured above) for every cast member. Facebook gives you the opportunity to be a bit more long-form with your posts, since you&#39;re not limited to 140 characters. <strong>Post great content to engage your followers</strong>.</p><p>We found that Facebook ads work surprisingly well. You can target people by location and even by what they &#39;like&#39; on Facebook. Depending on how you set your ads, you can reach a lot of people without a lot of money. Even just spending <strong>$100 can get you 50,000 impressions on Facebook</strong>!</p><p>Think about your show&#39;s theme: If your show is LGBT-themed, perhaps try targeting people who live in Vancouver and &#39;like&#39; the Vancouver Pride Society.</p><h2>4. Hook Media Outlets With An Angle</h2><p><img src=http://ck7hqgncgtv7pdtb.zippykid.netdna-cdn.com/img/circle-milkshake.png alt="">Early on in the rehearsal process, we compiled information about each of our cast members and set out to find media outlets that related to them. Media gets their interest piqued with a special angle, so we pitched different stories to different media outlets.</p><p>For each cast member, we contacted local newspapers in their neighbourhood:</p><p><a href=http://www.richmond-news.com/news/back-from-big-apple-local-actor-does-fringe-1.495862>Richmond News: Back From Big Apple, local actor does Fringe</a> <a href=http://www.newwestnewsleader.com/entertainment/167208725.html>New West News Leader: New West&#39;s Roberts stars in original musical</a></p><p>We also contacted their alma mater as well - many of our cast members graduated from Capilano University, so we got the Capilano Courier to put together a piece:</p><p><a href="http://capilanocourier.com/hearts-on-stage-sex-and-love-switch-hit-at-vancouvers-fringe/">Capilano Courier: Sex and love switch hit at Vancouver&#39;s Fringe</a></p><p>Special-interest groups also love to cover people from their groups as well:</p><p><a href="http://gayvancouver.net/2012-vancouver-fringe-festival/riverview-high-takes-its-inspiration-from-the-comics/">Gay Vancouver: Riverview High takes its inspiration from the comics</a> <a href=http://www.creativetechnology.org/video/access-w2tv-angela-wong-riverview-high-the-musical-at-2012>ACCESS/W2TV: Angela Wong - Riverview High: The Musical at 2012 Vancouver Fringe Festival</a></p><h2>3. Get word of mouth out early</h2><p>It&#39;s important to have a supportive crowd at opening. Make sure that all of your friends, family and loved ones come to opening night! Not only does it feel good for you as a performer, but <strong>getting positive word out of mouth at opening will do wonders for the run of your show</strong>.</p><p>Encourage reviewers come to opening, as well. If reviewers come to a show with a supportive audience, it automatically increases their enjoyment of the show. Also, getting press quotes early will help you out a lot!</p><h2>2. Flyer on Granville Island</h2><p><img src=http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo-1024x1024.jpg alt=photo>Come up with a 15-second pitch and hand out flyers on Granville Island. When shows are starting, there are always lines of people in front of theatres. <strong>Make sure that they all know what your show is about and compel them to come see it!</strong></p><p>You can print lots of flyers very cheaply at <a href=http://www.eastvangraphics.ca/digital-printing.shtml#P10>East Van Graphics</a> - look for the 4x6 postcards. I&#39;m not sponsored by them, but I just want to highlight them because they can turn around printing incredibly fast and they&#39;ve gotten me out of many tight situations before! They even give discounts for non-profits.</p><h2>1. Love Your Show</h2><p>The most important thing is for you to be enthusiastic about your work. Even in the face of technical issues, scheduling problems, or other setbacks, remember that you are the ambassador for your show. <strong>Keeping a positive attitude will be infectious and your excitement will drive people to see your show!</strong></p><hr><p><em>Riverview High: The Musical</em> came from the Vancouver Fringe Festival and we are forever indebted to them for giving us our start.
