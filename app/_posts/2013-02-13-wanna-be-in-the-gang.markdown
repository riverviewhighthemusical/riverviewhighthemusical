SYNOPSIS: Riverview High is an original musical that centers on a group of teenagers as they go through the trials and tribulations of friendship, love and sexuality in high school. The story follows Alex, a red-headed teenager, who has an important decision to make on graduation day: who will he embark on his future with - the sweet girl-next-door Cathy or the vivacious and wealthy Erica? The decision won't be easy, however, as Cathy and Erica have suitors of their own who are fighting to be with the girl of their dreams. Set in the mid-1990s, the musical was inspired by (and sometimes parodies) the popular teenage sitcoms and comics such as Saved By the Bell, Archie, California Dreams, etc.
