**Caleb Di Pomponio** returns to _Riverview High_ after winning audience's hearts as the loveable geek, Dexter, in the 2012 Vancouver Fringe debut.

"I really enjoy playing Dexter because I think everyone can relate to wanting to be with somebody who doesn't return those feelings."

Writer Stewart Yu remarks that "he was originally suggested to us for the role of Randy, but once he had gotten half way through his audition song, **I knew that Caleb was the perfect Dexter**."

Caleb's comedic chops endeared him to Fringe audiences, while his incredible voice will keep you humming "I Could Be The One" for weeks to come.

Caleb won the **2012 Outstanding Newcomer Award** for his work in _Riverview High_, _Fiddler On The Roof_ and _The Music Man_.

He is also a graduate of Capilano University and will be joining the cast of _Shrek The Musical_ this spring. [See Caleb's full bio.](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/cast#caleb-di-pomponio)
