**Ranae Miller** is thrilled to step into the role of Erica in _Riverview High_ after playing Sophie in the sell out 2012 Vancouver Fringe production.

"It's been so great working one-on-one with the writers - it's so fulfilling to get their feedback as an actor."

One of _Riverview High_'s highlights is **Ranae's vocal prowess** in Erica's challenging high-belt songs. She wins over the audience by pairing Erica's sassiness with her innate charm.

Ranae returns to _Riverview High_ fresh from her **Ovation Award nominated performance** as Tzeitel in _Fiddler On The Roof_. Check her out next as Princess Fiona in _Shrek The Musical_ next spring! [Ranae's full bio](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/cast#ranae-miller)
