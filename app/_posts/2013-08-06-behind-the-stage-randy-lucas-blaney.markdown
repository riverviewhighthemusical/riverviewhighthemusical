In our sixth episode (of 7) of Behind the Stage, we meet Randy, the playboy of Riverview High. He's got his sights set on Erica, but can Randy convince Erica that he is the perfect man for her before time runs out?

**Lucas Blaney** returns to _Riverview High_ after originating the role of the sharp-tongued playboy, Randy, in last year's sell-out Vancouver Fringe production.

"It's a lot of fun playing Randy because I get to play this heightened version of myself."

Fringe-goers love how **Lucas brings a cheeky bravado** to the role, while his powerful voice soars in Randy's musical numbers.

"I definitely put Lucas through the paces with this show - a lot of the vocal arrangements were created knowing that he's got this **incredible high tenor voice**," says composer/lyricist Stewart Yu.

Lucas is a graduate of the Canadian College for Performing Arts and this is his final theatre performance in Vancouver before moving to Toronto in the fall. [See Lucas' full bio.](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/cast#lucas-blaney)
