We are so happy to be putting on [Riverview High: The Musical](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/) again this year at the [Firehall Arts Centre](http://firehallartscentre.ca/). After our **sell out show** at the [Vancouver Fringe](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/) 2012 and winning Pick of the Fringe and the 2013 Outstanding Production Ovation Award, we're super excited to see some of our former cast members in some Vancouver shows.

**Daniel Cardoso** and **Cathy Wilmot** are in the cast of Legally Blonde put on by [Theatre Under the Stars](http://tuts.ca/) Vancouver - July 11, 2013 to August 16, 2013.

**Georgia Swinton, Lena Dabrusin** and **Julia Ullrich** in How to Succeed In Business Without Really Trying - July 10, 2013 to August 17, 2013.

**The 2013 production of Riverview High has been revised with 2 new songs.** Not only do we have some of Vancouver's brightest up and coming actors, but some well seasoned actors as well.

**[Erik Gow](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/cast) **will be taking the stage in the leading role of Alex with **[Alex Gullason](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/cast)** and **[Ranae Miller](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/cast)** as his love interests Cathy and Erica. All three are extremely talented and definitely not to be missed.

**Tickets are starting from $18 and are on sale online at [FirehallArtsCentre.ca](https://tickets.firehallartscentre.ca/TheatreManager/1/tmEvent/tmEvent578.html). Tickets will sell out, so purchase in advance to avoid disappointment.**
