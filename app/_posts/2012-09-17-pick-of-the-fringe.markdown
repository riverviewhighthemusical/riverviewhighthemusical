After eight fun-filled performances at the Firehall Arts Centre in the Vancouver International Fringe Festival, we are so excited to announce that Riverview High has been selected for Pick Of The Fringe!

We are just so overwhelmed with the amazing audience reaction that we have received and for everybody's support. We have had the most amazing time writing and producing this show for you and we just couldn't be happier with how it turned out!














On the first day of ticket sales, we were the fastest selling show and you helped us continue with that momentum to break records for being the highest selling show ever at the Vancouver International Fringe Festival!

At last night's Fringe Awards, we were so thrilled to have been runner up for Talk Of The Fringe and a winner of Pick Of The Fringe!
