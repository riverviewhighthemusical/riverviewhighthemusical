**Cameron Dunster** returns to the role of Parker in _Riverview High_ after originating the role in the sell out 2012 Vancouver Fringe production. "It's fun to play Parker because he has a lot of similarities to me - a lot of him is already right here!"

**Cameron's consistently goofy and loveable performance** made him a fan favourite in last year's production. 

"From the beginning, I knew that Cameron was the only person I wanted for this role," says Stewart Yu, one of the show's creators. Having the material specifically crafted for him, Cameron excels in the finding Parker's humourous side and **his inherent likeability shines through**.

Cameron won the **2012 Ovation Award for Outstanding Gypsy** for his work in _Riverview High_, _Victor/Victoria_ and other productions. [Check out Cameron's full bio](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/cast#cameron-dunster).
