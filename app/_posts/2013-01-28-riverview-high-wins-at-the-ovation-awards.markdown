_Mike and Stewart accepting the award_We cannot thank everybody enough - it is truly overwhelming to be honoured by the Vancouver theatre community with this award! Thank you to our wonderfully talented cast for turning our words into our dreams come true, our incredible crew for creating the show experience, our Kickstarter supporters for getting us on our feet, the Vancouver Fringe for getting the word out, the Firehall Arts Centre for giving us a chance and to Vancouver for watching and supporting us!!
