In our fifth episode (of 7) of Behind the Stage, we meet Esther, the most quirky, awkward girl at Riverview High. She is madly in love with Alex's best friend, Parker, and will do anything to get his attention. Will she finally get her way and go to prom with Parker?

**Michelle Bardach** is returning to _Riverview High_ after winning **Outstanding Supporting Actress** for originating the role of the quirky Esther in last year's Vancouver Fringe production.

"**Winning that award was beyond my wildest dreams.** I have dedicated my life to musical theatre, so it was so humbling to be recognized for my work."

**Michelle's hilarious performance endeared her to Fringe-goers**, while her powerful voice had people lining up to buy CDs after the show.

"She's the type of performer whose sharp comedic timing will have you in stitches in one scene, then dig deep to leave you heartbroken in the next," says composer/lyricist Stewart Yu.

Michelle has also won the **2012 Aida Broadbent Award** for professional conduct and performance for her performance in Titanic.

She is also a graduate of Capilano University and will be joining the cast of _Shrek The Musical_ this spring. [See Michelle's full bio.](http://riverviewhighthemusical.com/cast#michelle-bardach)
