        <p>It's the classic story of a <strong>love triangle</strong>: a sweet <strong>blonde</strong>, a sexy <strong>brunette</strong>, and an ever-so-confused <strong>redhead</strong>. Set in 1996, the musical begins with Alex accidentally asking both Cathy and Erica to prom.</p>

        <p>When the girls find out, they demand he choose which one he wants to embark on his future with - <strong>girl-next-door Cathy or sophisticated Erica</strong>?</p>

        <p>Such a big decision can be hard for a teenage boy, so <strong>Alex enlists his girl-hating and hot-dog-loving best friend, Parker</strong>, for help. But he needs to make his decision quickly because both Cathy and Erica have suitors of their own (<strong>Randy</strong> and <strong>Dexter</strong>) who are vying to be with the girl of their dreams.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Parker is wrapped up in his own girl problems, since <strong>Esther</strong> just doesn't take no for an answer!</p>

        <p><strong>So will it be Cathy? Will it be Erica?</strong> Who's it gonna be? Just wait and see!</p>
