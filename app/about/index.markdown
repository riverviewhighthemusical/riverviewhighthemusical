It's the classic story of a **love triangle**: a sweet **blonde**, a sexy **brunette**, and an ever-so-confused **redhead**. Set in 1996, the musical begins with Alex accidentally asking both Cathy and Erica to prom.

When the girls find out, they demand he choose which one he wants to embark on his future with - **girl-next-door Cathy or sophisticated Erica**?

Such a big decision can be hard for a teenage boy, so **Alex enlists his girl-hating and hot-dog-loving best friend, Parker**, for help. But he needs to make his decision quickly because both Cathy and Erica have suitors of their own (**Randy** and **Dexter**) who are vying to be with the girl of their dreams.

Meanwhile, Parker is wrapped up in his own girl problems, since **Esther** just doesn't take no for an answer!

**So will it be Cathy? Will it be Erica?** Who's it gonna be? Just wait and see!
